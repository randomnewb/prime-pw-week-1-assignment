# 3 - What is the command for going "up" a folder (to a parent directory)?

# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?

# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?

Nothing should show up/it will ask you to input a new command.
It will list the names/extensions of the files.

# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?

touch "name of file.extension"

# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?

2.36.1

# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?

To verify that you are working on the same project on your computer and on the online respository (in this case, GitHub).
I also looked it up. It lets you know what has been 'added' (through git add) and committed (through git commit)
to the 'staging area'. Basically, verify what changes you've made. 

# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?

It adds files that you have edited to a holding area. Whereas 'git commit -m "message of what you have changed"'
takes files you have added and edited and adds them to a queue where you can provide version change notes.

# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?

git push origin main
